    # each parameter represents the quantity per denomination of money
    # these parameters can be assigned to instance variables and used for computation

    # add a method called 'change' that takes in a parameter of how much an item costs
    # and returns a hash of how much change is to be given
    # the hash will use the denominations as keys and the amount per denomination as values
    # i.e. {:fives => 1, fifties => 1, :hundreds => 3}
